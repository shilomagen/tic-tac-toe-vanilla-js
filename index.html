      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
        </li>
        <li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting
          their marks in empty squares.
        </li>
        <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the
          winner.
        </li>
        <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the
          game ends in a tie.
        </li>
